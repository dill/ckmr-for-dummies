Some definitions because I don't know about genetic

- **allele**:
- **locus**/**loci**:
- **Medelian exclusion**:


# Doing CKMR

There are three stages to CKMR:

1. *genotyping*: actually getting the biological samples and coding them into something that the computer can read. This is done by "elves" according to MVB -- soem biological thing that takes the samples, cuts up the DNA and gets interesting sections (alleles/loci).
2. *kin pair finding*: working out whether a given pair of animals are related by looking at whether there are matches in alleles. "Kin" can refer to a number of different relationships, only some of which are "interesting".
3. *close-kin mark-recapture*: actually doing the CKMR, thinking about population dynamics etc.
